# itunesrss

Retrieve an RSS url from an iTunes podcast web url. Doesn't require
server-side code.

For many years I was using `getrssfeed dot com` for precisely that
until it suddenly started to aggressively advertise its own podcast
player instead of just retrieving rss urls. ğŸ˜¡

## Compilation

Reqs: `npm i -g adieu`

Type `make`. Give `_out/web` dir to any static web server.
